# Video Processing Pipeline Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to fix video processing issues for longer videos (2+ minutes) in the HuddleAI platform.

## Issues Identified
1. **Timeout Issues**: Cloud Functions had insufficient timeout limits for longer video processing
2. **Memory Limitations**: Insufficient memory allocation for processing larger files
3. **Synchronous Speech Recognition**: Using sync API for files that required async processing
4. **File Size Limits**: Storage rules and frontend validation limited to 500MB
5. **Frontend Polling Timeout**: Frontend gave up too early on processing status checks
6. **Speech API Duration Limit**: Google Cloud Speech sync API has a 60-second limit that was being exceeded

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Cloud Functions Configuration Updates

#### Increased Timeouts and Resources
- **processMeetingUpload**: Timeout increased from 540s to 1800s (30 minutes)
- **Memory**: Increased from 1GiB to 2GiB for video processing
- **CPU**: Increased to 2 cores for faster processing
- **reprocessMeeting**: Timeout increased to 300s with 1GiB memory

#### Improved Error Handling
- Better file size validation before processing
- Graceful handling of large file downloads
- Comprehensive error logging with context

### 2. Speech Recognition Improvements

#### Duration-Based API Selection (CRITICAL FIX)
```typescript
// Get audio duration to determine which API to use
const audioDuration = await getAudioDuration(audioPath);

// Google Cloud Speech API limits:
// - Synchronous: max 60 seconds (1 minute)
// - Asynchronous: required for longer files
// Use async for files longer than 50 seconds to be safe
if (audioDuration > 50 || audioSizeMB > 10) {
  return await convertSpeechToTextAsync(audioPath);
} else {
  return await convertSpeechToTextSync(audioPath);
}
```

#### Enhanced Audio Processing
- Streaming audio extraction for better memory management
- Improved FFmpeg configuration for larger files
- Better temporary file cleanup
- Audio duration detection using FFmpeg probe

#### Speech Recognition Configuration
- Enhanced audio encoding settings for better accuracy
- Speaker diarization for multi-speaker meetings
- Language detection and optimization
- Fallback to async recognition if duration detection fails

### 3. File Size and Storage Updates

#### Storage Rules
- Maximum file size increased from 500MB to 1GB
- Support for temporary processing files
- Better access control for different file types

#### Frontend Validation
- File size validation updated to 1GB limit
- Better error messages for oversized files
- Improved user feedback during upload

### 4. Frontend Processing Improvements

#### Extended Polling Timeout
- Polling timeout increased from 5 minutes to 30 minutes
- Better error messages when processing takes too long
- Improved status updates during long processing

#### Upload Progress Enhancement
- Better progress tracking for large files
- More informative status messages
- Graceful handling of processing delays

### 5. Audio Extraction Improvements

#### Streaming Processing
```typescript
// Stream-based audio extraction for better memory management
const command = ffmpeg(tempVideoPath)
  .audioCodec('pcm_s16le')
  .audioFrequency(16000)
  .audioChannels(1)
  .format('wav')
  .on('start', (commandLine) => {
    logger.info('Audio extraction started', { commandLine });
  })
  .on('progress', (progress) => {
    logger.info('Audio extraction progress', { 
      percent: progress.percent,
      timemark: progress.timemark 
    });
  });
```

#### Better Error Recovery
- Retry mechanisms for failed extractions
- Fallback audio formats
- Comprehensive cleanup on failures

### 6. Processing Pipeline Optimization

#### File Size Management
- Proper file size detection and validation
- Memory-efficient processing for large files
- Streaming where possible to reduce memory usage

#### Processing Status Updates
- Real-time status updates during processing
- Better error state management
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Technical Specifications

### Resource Limits
| Component | Previous | Updated |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Function Timeout | 540s (9 min) | 1800s (30 min) |
| Memory Allocation | 1GiB | 2GiB |
| CPU Cores | 1 | 2 |
| Max File Size | 500MB | 1GB |
| Frontend Polling | 5 min | 30 min |

### Speech Recognition Thresholds
- **Synchronous API**: Files ≤ 50 seconds duration AND ≤ 10MB audio
- **Asynchronous API**: Files > 50 seconds duration OR > 10MB audio
- **Audio Format**: 16kHz, mono, WAV
- **Language**: Auto-detection with fallback to English
- **Fallback**: If duration detection fails, defaults to async recognition

### Processing Flow
1. **Upload Validation**: Check file size and type
2. **Storage**: Upload to Firebase Storage with 1GB limit
3. **Trigger**: Cloud Function triggered on file upload
4. **Audio Extraction**: Stream-based extraction with FFmpeg
5. **Speech Recognition**: Sync/Async based on file size
6. **AI Processing**: Generate summary, action items, decisions
7. **Storage**: Save transcript and metadata
8. **Notification**: Send Slack notification if configured
9. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files

## Testing Results

### Before Improvements
- ❌ 2-minute videos: Processing failed with timeout
- ❌ Large files: Memory errors during processing
- ❌ User experience: Confusing error messages

### After Improvements
- ✅ 2-minute videos: Successfully processed
- ✅ Large files: Handled up to 1GB
- ✅ User experience: Clear progress and error messages
- ✅ Processing time: Optimized for various file sizes

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Enhanced Logging
- File size and processing metrics
- Step-by-step processing status
- Error context and stack traces
- Performance timing information

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Manual reprocessing function available
- Comprehensive error reporting to users

## Future Considerations

### Potential Optimizations
1. **Parallel Processing**: Split large files into chunks
2. **Progressive Upload**: Resume interrupted uploads
3. **Compression**: Automatic video compression before processing
4. **Caching**: Cache processed audio for reprocessing scenarios

### Scalability

- ✅ Comprehensive testing completed

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Upload video files up to 1GB in size
2. Expect processing times of 2-5 minutes for typical meeting recordings
3. Check meeting details page if processing takes longer than expected
4. Use reprocess function if initial processing fails

### For Developers
1. Monitor Cloud Function logs for processing status
2. Check Firebase Storage for uploaded files
3. Use the reprocessMeeting function for failed uploads
4. Review error logs for debugging processing issues

This comprehensive update ensures reliable video processing for meetings of various lengths and sizes, providing a robust foundation for the HuddleAI platform's core functionality.
