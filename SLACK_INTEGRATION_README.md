## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React component for managing integrations
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions for processing and sending notifications
- **Storage**: Firestore for storing integration configurations
- **API**: Slack Incoming Webhooks for message delivery

### Security
- Webhook URLs are stored securely in Firestore
- Only team owners and admins can manage integrations
- All API calls are authenticated through Firebase Auth
